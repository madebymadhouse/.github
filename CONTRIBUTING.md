## Commit Style

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat:     new feature
fix:      bug fix
docs:     documentation only
style:    formatting, no logic change
refactor: no feature/fix, just structure
perf:     performance
test:     tests only
chore:    tooling, CI, deps
```

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork or branch (if you have write access)
2. Install deps (`npm ci` or `pnpm install`)
3. Type-check must pass
4. Linting must pass
5. Commit with conventional commits
6. Open a focused PR — one concern per PR
7. CI must be green before merge
