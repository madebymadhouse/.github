## How to Get Involved

1. **Reach out directly** — [hello@wokspec.org](mailto:hello@wokspec.org). Tell us what you do, what you're interested in, and link relevant work.
2. **Look at open issues** — public repos have labeled issues. `good first issue` and `help wanted` are the entry points.
3. **Propose something** — if you see a gap or have an idea, open an issue first before submitting a PR.

## Commit Style

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat:     new feature
fix:      bug fix
docs:     documentation only
style:    formatting, no logic change
refactor: no feature/fix, just structure
perf:     performance
test:     tests only
chore:    tooling, CI, deps
```

---

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork or branch (if you have write access)
2. `npm ci` to install
3. `npx tsc --noEmit` — must pass
4. `npx eslint . --max-warnings 0` — must pass
5. Commit with conventional commits
6. Open PR — small and focused, one concern per PR
7. CI must be green before merge
